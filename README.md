# VPN
VPN creation with AWS EC2 and OPENVPN software
A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a technology that allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the internet. It can be used to protect your online privacy, encrypt your internet traffic, and give you access to content that might be restricted in your region. By connecting to a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server, which then forwards it to your destination website or application. This makes it difficult for anyone to intercept or eavesdrop on your online activity.
